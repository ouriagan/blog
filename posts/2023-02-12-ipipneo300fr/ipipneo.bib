	abstract = {The Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) and its latest version, the NEO-PI-3, were designed to measure 30 distinctive personality traits, which are grouped into Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness domains. The mean self-rated NEO-PI-R scores for 30 subscales have been reported for 36 countries or cultures in 2002. As a follow-up, this study reports the mean scores of the NEO-PI-R/3 for 71,870 participants from 76 samples and 62 different countries or cultures and 37 different languages. Mean differences in personality traits across countries and cultures were about 8.5 times smaller than differences between any two individuals randomly selected from these samples. Nevertheless, a multidimensional scaling of similarities and differences in the mean profile shape showed a clear clustering into distinctive groups of countries or cultures. This study provides further evidence that country/culture mean scores in personality are replicable and can provide reliable information about personality dispositions.},

	abstract = {This is a comprehensive treatment of the subject, embracing the definition of personality and a history of characterology; a consideration of such fundamental concepts as heredity, growth, the self, the transformation of motives ("functional autonomy") and maturity; the structure of personality with special reference to traits, their specificity and consistency; methods of investigation, including psychography, rating, testing and experimental procedures; and the general problem of understanding personality through judgment, inference and intuition. These topics are discussed historically, expositionally and critically. The chief thesis of the work is the uniqueness of the individual. Supporting concepts are the consistency of traits and the functional autonomy (contemporaneousness) of motives. The author attempts, however, "to respect the many-sidedness of the subject-matter of this new science." Thorough documentation assists in this direction.

	abstract = {Caspi (1998), Asendorpf and Van Aken (1999), and Asendorpf et al. (2001) described three personality types derived from Q‐factor analysis of Q‐sorts or cluster analysis of multiple trait ratings. The types were labelled as resilients, undercontrollers, and overcontrollers and they were described in terms of averaged Five‐Factor Model (FFM) scores. The present study aimed to investigate the consistency and replicability of these prototypes across different FFM measures (i.e. HiPIC and NEO PI‐R) and ages (children and adolescents). In addition, the stability of prototype classification across a 3 year interval was examined. The types described by Caspi and Asendorpf and colleagues were only partially replicable and consistent across ages starting from HiPIC ratings, but not for NEO‐PI‐R ratings. Prototype classification was not stable across a 3 year interval. It is concluded that cluster replicability, consistency, and stability depend on sample characteristics and the multiple trait measures, although these difficulties do not necessarily limit the usefulness of the types for applied purposes.

	abstract = {This study presents new analyses of NEO Personality Inventory–Revised (NEO-PI-R) responses collected from a large British sample in a high-stakes setting. The authors show the appropriateness of the five-factor model underpinning these responses in a variety of new ways. Using the recently developed exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) technique, the authors show that model fits improve markedly over conventional confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) of the same data set, but that (a) factor interpretations do not change under ESEM analyses, (b) ESEM factor scores, just like CFA factors scores, correlate at near unity with sums of observed scores, (c) NEO-PI-R facets under ESEM analyses are invariant across gender, and (d) ESEM highlights the inappropriateness of alpha and beta as a higher order representation of NEO-PI-R facets, whereas a CFA approach might lead researchers to believe in the appropriateness of these higher order factors. These results, coupled with the existing validity evidence for the NEO-PI-R, suggest that the five-factor structure is the most parsimonious structure for summarizing NEO-PI-R responses from high-stakes settings in the United Kingdom.},

Testing the structural validity of trait measurements is paramount in this endeavor. In the current study, we investigated 30 facet traits in one of the accessible and comprehensive public-domain Five Factor Model (FFM) personality inventories, IPIP-NEO-120 (Johnson, 2014), using one of the largest US samples to date (N = 320,128). We present structural loadings for all trait facets organized into respective FFM-trait domain (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness). Both hierarchical second-order and bi-factor models showed tolerable model fit indices, using confirmatory factor analysis in a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. Some facet traits were substantially more representative than others for their respective trait domain, which facilitate further discussions on FFM-construct content. We conclude that IPIP-NEO is sufficiently structurally robust for future use, for the benefit of research and practice in personality assessment.},

A sample of 353 diverse students from a large U.S. university completed both measures. Structural equation modeling was used to conduct the multitrait-multimethod, multiple-group, and latent mean analyses. A model with five correlated trait factors and two method factors provided the best fit to the data. Support for convergent and discriminant validity was also found. Racial and gender differences were relatively small for both instruments. These results support the construct validity of the IPIP. However, neither the NEO-FFI nor the IPIP produced a very good fit when analyzing item-level data, suggesting considerable room for improvement.},

Participants who completed the NEO-FFI were university students (65\%), professionals of education and health (27\%), and a small group of older people (8\%). Item-level analyses provided reliability measures and factor structure of the NEO-FFI. The N, E, and C scales showed higher internal consistency and homogeneity than A and O. Some weaker items, particularly in the O scale, were found. Overall, its reliability and factor structure were in line with results reported in other studies; in addition, the analyses provided similar means of scales and intercorrelations between the five factors. The present study found that normative data of Neuroticism and Conscientiousness scales can be improved in the Spanish edition of the NEO-FFI. The discussion includes the utility of improved norms for the profile analysis, suggesting its applicability as a dimensional measure for personality disorders.},

As in a previous study of self-reports (McCrae \& Costa, 1985b), adjective factors of neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness–antagonism, and conscientiousness–undirectedness were identified in an analysis of 738 peer ratings of 275 adult subjects. Intraclass correlations among raters, ranging from .30 to .65, and correlations between mean peer ratings and self-reports, from .25 to .62, showed substantial cross-observer agreement on all five adjective factors. Similar results were seen in analyses of scales from the NEO Personality Inventory. Items from the adjective factors were used as guides in a discussion of the nature of the five factors. These data reinforce recent appeals for the adoption of the five-factor model in personality research and assessment. (69 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

They evaluated the extent to which (a) psychometric properties of facet scales are generalizable across ages, cultures, and methods of measurement, and, (b) validity criteria are associated with different forms of reliability. Composite estimates of facet scale stability, heritability, and cross-observer validity were broadly generalizable. Two estimates of retest reliability were independent predictors of the three validity criteria; none of three estimates of internal consistency was. Available evidence suggests the same pattern of results for other personality inventories. Internal consistency of scales can be useful as a check on data quality but appears to be of limited utility for evaluating the potential validity of developed scales, and it should not be used as a substitute for retest reliability. Further research on the nature and determinants of retest reliability is needed.},

Findings indicated satisfactory recovery of full-scale facet scores with the administration of around four items per facet scale. Thus, the NEO PI-R could be reduced in half with little loss in precision by CAT administration. However, results also indicated that the CAT algorithm was not necessary. We found that for many scales, administering the "best" four items per facet scale would have produced similar results. In the conclusion, we discuss the future of computerized personality assessment and describe the role IRT methods might play in such assessments.},

Then, the most common goodness-of-fit indices are discussed and some recommendations for practitioners given.

RWA was predicted by low Openness to Experience but also Conscientiousness, whereas SDO was predicted by low Agreeableness and also weakly by low Openness to Experience. Consistent with a dual-process motivational model of ideology and prejudice, the effects of Agreeableness on prejudice were fully mediated by SDO, and those of Openness to Experience were largely mediated by RWA. Finally, the effects of Agreeableness and Openness to Experience were robust and consistent across samples, although subtle moderating factors were identified, including differences in personality inventory (NEO Personality Inventory—Revised vs. Big Five Inventory), differences across prejudice domain, and cross-cultural differences in Conscientiousness and Neuroticism. Implications for the study of personality and prejudice are discussed.},

	abstract = {Back-translation is a validation tool widely used in international research settings, including, but not limited to, cross-cultural psychology, international marketing, educational assessments, quality of life research, and international nursing research. As a rule, researchers use back-translation to validate the quality of translated research instruments, such as tests and questionnaires. The method consists in re-translating the translated text back into the source language. The back-translation and the original document are compared for inconsistencies, and if none are found, the translation is considered equivalent. The method has many adherents and opponents; however, neither uses solid linguistic evidence in their arguments. This study is an attempt to suggest a theoretical linguistic framework for describing and evaluating the back-translation process, namely the cognitive linguistics approach, with the main focus on Langacker‟s Cognitive Grammar. The study is illustrated with examples from actual questionnaires translated from English into Ukrainian.},

	abstract = {The authors examined whether individuals can fake their responses to a personality inventory if instructed to do so. Between-subjects and within-subject designs were metaanalyzed separately. Across 51 studies, fakability did not vary by personality dimension; all the Big Five factors were equally fakable. Faking produced the largest distortions in social desirability scales. Instructions to fake good produced lower effect sizes compared with instructions to fake bad. Comparing meta-analytic results from within-subjects and between-subjects designs, we conclude, based on statistical and methodological considerations, that within-subjects designs produce more accurate estimates. Between-subjects designs may distort estimates due to Subject × Treatment interactions and low statistical power.},
